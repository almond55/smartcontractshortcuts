Edit SmolToken.sol with your token name, token symbol, decimal and total supply, in that order. 

Change your contract name accordingly to roughly match your token name.

Deploy the token with your new contract name.

If you are deploying via truffle with `truffle migrate`, put the migration js file in the migration folder and change the 'X' to your deployment script number. (i.e If you have 2 migrations scripts in the folder already, this one would be `3_smoltoken_migration.js`)
